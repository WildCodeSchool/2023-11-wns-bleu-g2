## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Our project, Christmas Gifts Planner, is a collaborative effort by a team of 4 individuals undergoing training as web developer designers. The project aims to facilitate members of a family or group of friends to discuss gift ideas without seeing what others are preparing for them. A dedicated discussion thread would be allocated to each member, enabling other members to exchange individual or collective gift ideas.
